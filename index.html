                            Peter Dueck Wiebe passed away due to complications from pneumonia on November 3, 2014 at around 2:20am in the Rouge Valley Hospital in Ajax, ON. Peter was born on December 7, 1922 in Steinbach, MB. Peter married his wife, Esther Thiessen, on June 20, 1970 in Winnipeg, MB. Peter is survived by his loving wife Esther and three children Eunice (Josh) Van Bergen, David (Elisabeth) Wiebe, and Jeremy (Hannah) Wiebe, as well as one sister, Margaret Janzen.  Peter also has six grandchildren: Rebekah, Julia, Gideon, Jacob, Jackson, and Madeline.  Peter was predeceased by his parents Abram and Elizabeth Wiebe and his siblings Abram, Henry, and Bernhard.  Peter attended the Mitchell school in Mitchell, MB through Grade 6, at which time he was needed on the family farm and stopped going to school. Peter farmed and worked as a custodian and carpenter much of his life.  The funeral service for Peter Wiebe was held on November 6, 2014 at FaithWay Baptist Church in Ajax, ON.

                    	It was on the farm near Steinbach, Manitoba where Peter was born.  He was born to Abram and Elisabeth Wiebe on December 7, 1922 at about 5 in the afternoon.  Abram and Elisabeth named him Peter Dueck and Dueck was his mom's maiden name.  This name would carry much significance later on in Peter's life.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Dad's parents, Abram &amp; Elisabeth, had five children.  Abram, Margaret, and Henry were older than Peter, and Bernard was the youngest.  Tragically, Elisabeth passed away on January 14th, 1925 {Shortly thereafter his younger brother, Bernard, also passed away at the age of 9 months on September 25, 1925} .  Six years, six months, and two weeks after his dad, Abram was married, he found himself a widower with 4 young children.  
                    </p>
					<p>
						Being a farmer, Abram had his hands full not only running the farm but also raising his children.  This left Peter, age 6 and his older sister Margaret who was just 8 to do all of the housework while the older boys helped with the farm. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						Living on a farm that had been built many years before had it's challenges including small drifts of snow forming inside the house as wind found it's way through the cracks in the doorway. Dad attended school up until grade 6 but at that time was forced to dropout as the house work became too much and his father considered school to be a waste of time.  
                    </p>
					<p>
						Dad came to know Jesus Christ at an early age. He did not have access to a church setting with large Sunday School programs and youth meetings.  Dad did take his relationship with Christ very seriously and loved his Lord and Maker.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Tragedy followed dad into his adult life when his father  passed away when dad was 29.  His older brother, and best friend, Henry, passed away shortly after that, when dad was 31.  The loss of his mother and Henry had a huge impact on dad throughout his life.  Growing up without a mother was something that Dad lamented quite often but when he sees her in Heaven,  I'm sure it will be one of his greatest joys.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Dad was a Mennonite and Mennonites are pacifists.  One of the things that the Mennonites did when they immigrated to Canada was to enter an agreement with the Canadian government to allow them to farm the land and not be conscripted as a soldier.  This service as a Conscientious Objector (CO) was hard work, and vital for providing our soldiers with food.  Dad, and his brothers, exercised this right during WWII.  He worked on a farm near Winnipeg for 18 months.  He worked 6 days a week usually 14 hours a day as a servant for his country.
                    </p>
					<p>
						After the war Dad went back home to farm.  It became clear that the family farm would not be big enough to support both he and his older brother Abram, who was already married with children.  Dad moved to Winnipeg to find work (or as dad put it, "to go work out.")  Dad spent many years working for a ceiling company in northern Ontario installing acoustic ceilings. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						His niece, Bertha, recalls that Dad was always a generous man.  Before he was married he'd participate in the Christmas name drawing for gifts with his sister's family.  The kids always looked forward to having "Uncle Peter" get their name as they knew that meant they'd get a gift far above what the others got.  Aunt Margaret, Peter's sister, still owns and uses a flatware set that he bought for her as a gift one Christmas.  Dad valued good quality and good style and that was reflected in his clothing, grooming, and the things he bought.  
                    </p>
					<p>
						In December 1969 at the age of 47 Peter (Dad) met Esther Thiessen (Mom). Through a series of circumstances involving mom’s close personal friend, Eleanor Stewart, and Eleanor’s co-worker, they had their first date. The date consisted of supper (at a well known restaurant) and a trip to the planetarium to see the Christmas Star. After several days of not hearing from Dad, Mom thought to herself "Well, I guess that's that!" How surprised she was when he called back 4 days later and asked her out again. They began dating and in about 6 months they were married on June 20, 1970.
                    </p>
					<p>
						For their honeymoon Mom and Dad took an exceptionally romantic trip to Lake Louise, but not alone. They were accompanied by Peter's sister and brother-in-law, to whom Peter had always promised a trip out west. Thankfully, mom was gracious and this didn't end their marriage! In fact, their marriage was blessed with three children - Eunice, David, and Jeremy.
                    </p>
					<p>
						For the next 2 years they lived in Winnipeg and both worked at Donwood Manor together. Following this, they took 2 trips to Belize as missionaries to work with a Bible College ministry. Unfortunately their second missions trip was cut short as Dad's health was affected by the intense summer heat.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Their first child, Eunice, was born December 12, 1971.  David followed shortly after on January 24, 1973, and Jeremy, their youngest, was born January 2, 1976.  
						Dad was never afraid of hard work.  When dad and mom moved to Kola they originally planned on farming.  After three consecutive crop failures they sold the farmland and dad started working as a custodian at the Kola School.  He also worked at the hospital where mom worked doing maintenance also.  Dad worked two jobs for many years.  Jeremy and Dave both fondly remember going out on Saturdays in the fall to cut firewood.  They'd bring home the firewood and stack it and then it was Dave and Jeremy's responsibility to cut the wood to smaller pieces and bring it in every Saturday over the winter to help heat the house.  Even late in his life dad didn't shy away from work.  As recently as a few months before his death Dad would spend a few hours at a time counting coins at the church, not just a few rolls at a time, but many hundreds of coins per session.  
                    </p>
					<p>
						One of the things that mom and dad both enjoyed was singing.  In his later years they didn't sing together so much but Dad still enjoyed singing.  All of us kids remember Dad walking around the house singing some hymn at the top of his lungs with a healthy dose of vibrato.  At family events before a meal dad would usually sing the doxology instead of a spoken prayer.  Just when people were ready to bow their heads dad would break into it by starting the song… "Praise God from whom all blessing flow…"   In day-to-day meals the prayer was always the same.  "God is great, God is good, Let us thank him for our food.  Amen"  As kids we knew this off by heart and looking back it's something that will always remind us of our father.  
                    </p>
					<p>
						Over the years Dad found an interest in a variety of things.  Sometimes these were not what you’d expect from a man in his 50’s and 60’s.  For example, he started learning accordion when he was in his late 50’s.  Eunice and Dave remember listening to “Camptown Races” many evening when they were already in.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Dad was a good man and usually had good judgement.  Every so often, though, he was just too trusting of others.  Dad bought a red Toyota Corolla hatchback on one occasion.  I'm not sure if took it for a test drive, but on the way home from Brandon we noticed that the floor of the car was completely rusted through and there was a 6-inch hold in the floor.  Dad's simple solution was to cut a piece of plywood and place it over the hole.  We drove the car like that for the entire time we owned that car.  When we'd drive on gravel roads the entire car would fill with dust, but it got us where we needed to go. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						Dad was a very punctual person.  If he was 5 minutes early he was late.  The kids remember that any time the family was going anywhere Dad wanted to leave extra time for everything.  A family joke was that if we were going somewhere that was even 15 minutes away, we had to leave 30 minutes early to give time to get shoes on, put on jackets, get to the car, put on seatbelts, etc. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						Because Dad only had a grade 6 education he was always conscious of his lack of schooling.  This did not stop him from studying his Bible and improving his vocabulary.  Dad spent much time in his Bible and then researching words he came across that he didn’t' always know.  He truly "studied to show himself approved unto God."  In his drive to upgrade his knowledge and vocabulary he occasionally got things wrong or understood the context of a definition not quite right.  We fondly remember Dad talking about some situation wreaking "hovac" on his plans. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						In his retirement years he spent many hours studying the Bible and compiling booklets and tracts on various topics.  He was never ashamed of sharing his faith with others and give out tracts to people wherever he went.  When it was time for him to raise his own family, he made sure that they never missed a service and that his children understood the importance of having a personal relationship with Jesus. Family devotions and Bible memorization was a daily routine as a family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
						Dad became interested in his family genealogy later in his life.  He spent many hours researching his family history and documenting it (with mom's help).  He organized a large Wiebe reunion held on June 13, 2010 in Manitoba.  There were Wiebe family members from Canada, US, and Paraguay.  Shortly after this he completely lost interest in genealogy.
                    </p>
					<p>
						In August of 2010 mom and dad moved to Toronto from Altona, MB.  All of their children were living in Toronto at the time and it made sense for them to be closer.  This was a bit of a difficult transition coming from a small, rural town to the big city of Toronto.  Despite these changes, both mom and dad embraced it.  Over the next 4 years we got to spend a lot of time with mom and dad and got to know our parents as adults.  This was such a huge blessing and a source of many surprises as we got to know their character and heart at a level we didn't know or understand as kids.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Peter is survived by his loving wife of 44 years, Esther; his three children and their spouses, Eunice &amp; Josh, David &amp; Liz, and Jeremy &amp; Hannah; and 6 fantastic grandchildren, Rebekah, Julia, Gideon, Jacob, Jackson, and Madeline. For a man who thought he would never have children, let alone grandchildren, He felt truly blessed.
                    </p>
					<p>
						No longer in our arms, but always in our hearts, we will miss you, Dad, and we will look forward to the day when we will be reunited with you in the presence of our Saviour.
